# About the project
This project is an interactive grid for visualizing pathfinding algorithms. The grid allows you to dynamically explore how different pathfinding algorithms work. It uses the following technologies:

- Vue 3 (with Typescript & Composition API)
- TailwindCSS
- Algorithmes and Data Structure
