- Interactive grid for pathfinding visualization
- Movable start and end points
- Add and remove walls dynamically
- Supports various pathfinding algorithms
- Animated paths to show the algorithm in action
- Clear pathing and visited cells

# Prerequisites
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

# Installation

```sh
cd client/
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

# Usage

After following the installation steps, the application should be running locally. Open your browser and navigate to the localhost URL provided by the pnpm dev command. You can then interact with the grid to visualize various pathfinding algorithms.
